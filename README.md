# RNN-implementation

This repository contains the implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using the IMDb dataset for sentiment analysis. The project demonstrates the use of RNNs for natural language processing tasks, including text classification.

**The project includes:**

**Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Loading the IMDb dataset, performing feature engineering, tokenization, and preparing the data for RNN input.

**Model Training:** Training a simple RNN with embedding layers to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras.

**Prediction:** Making predictions on user-provided text inputs using the trained RNN model.

**Streamlit Application:** A user-friendly web application developed using Streamlit that integrates the trained RNN model for real-time sentiment analysis. Users can input movie reviews and get predictions instantly.

This project demonstrates how RNNs can be effectively used for text-based classification tasks and provides an interactive interface for exploring sentiment analysis.
